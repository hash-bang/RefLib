AB  - Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA) is characterized by sudden onset of severe,
      non-abating pain in the shoulder girdle and/or the upper limb and amyotrophy
      (muscle wasting or atrophy) that typically develops within two weeks of the onset
      of severe pain. Other sites may also be involved in an attack; sensory symptoms, 
      present in the majority of affected individuals, can include hypoesthesia
      (decreased sensation) and paresthesias. Onset is typically in the second or third
      decade (median age 28 years). Although attacks appear to become less frequent
      with age, residual deficits accumulate with subsequent attacks. In some families,
      non-neurologic findings (characteristic craniofacial features, bifid uvula or
      cleft palate, short stature, and/or partial syndactyly of the fingers or toes)
      are present. The diagnosis of HNA is based on clinical findings. SEPT9 is the
      only gene in which mutation is known to cause HNA; however, genetic heterogeneity
      exists. Treatment of manifestations: Pain management is the primary goal of
      therapy and varies between acute and chronic stages. Corticosteroids have been
      used in the acute phase to shorten the duration of pain and improve recovery.
      Consultation with a physiatrist is recommended for chronic pain and persisting
      paresis. Patients with phrenic nerve palsy need specialized respiratory
      consultation and can benefit from noninvasive nocturnal positive pressure
      ventilation. Cleft palate is managed by standard protocols. Surveillance: Follow 
      up every six to 12 months after the initial diagnosis to identify chronic pain
      resulting from altered biomechanics of the shoulder or arm. Agents/circumstances 
      to avoid: Overexertion of a limb with persistent weakness, especially if the
      scapula is unstable. Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy is inherited in an autosomal
      dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with HNA have an affected parent; the
      proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child
      of an individual with HNA has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. 
      Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the
      pathogenic variant in the family is known.

TI  - Validation of the four-dimensional symptom questionnaire (4DSQ) and prevalence of
      psychological symptoms in orthopedic shoulder patients.
PG  - 683-91

AB  - Psychological problems are common in shoulder patients. A validated psychological
      questionnaire measuring clinically relevant psychological symptoms (including
      distress, depression, anxiety, and somatization) in shoulder patients is lacking.
      The Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) is a self-report questionnaire 
      to identify distress, depression, anxiety, and somatization which has been
      validated in primary care populations. The aim of this study was to validate the 
      4DSQ in orthopedic shoulder patients. We assessed whether the 4DSQ measures these
      four constructs the same way in an orthopedic population with shoulder problems
      compared to a general practice population. We also investigated the prevalence of
      psychological symptoms in shoulder patients. The shoulder group consisted of 200 
      consecutive patients and the general practice group comprised 368 patients,
      matched for gender and age. Differential item functioning analysis showed that
      the 4DSQ measures the different psychological symptoms in orthopedic shoulder
      patients the same way as in general practice patients. The shoulder patients
      tended to score higher on the somatization scale, resulting in a new cut-off
      point for somatization. The prevalence of distress, somatization, anxiety, and
      depression in the shoulder group was 23%, 14%, 10%, and 8%, respectively. It can 
      be concluded from this study that the 4DSQ in orthopedic shoulder patients
      measures the same constructs as in general practice patients and can therefore be
      used in orthopedic practice to measure psychological symptoms in patients with
      shoulder complaints.

TI  - Trajectories of musculoskeletal shoulder pain after spinal cord injury:
      Identification and predictors.
PG  - 288-98
LID - 10.1179/2045772313Y.0000000168 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Although shoulder pain is a problem in up to 86% of persons
      with a spinal cord injury (SCI), so far, no studies have empirically identified
      longitudinal patterns (trajectories) of musculoskeletal shoulder pain after SCI. 
      The objective of this study was: (1) to identify distinct trajectories of
      musculoskeletal shoulder pain in persons with SCI, and (2) to determine possible 
      predictors of these trajectories. DESIGN/METHODS: Multicenter, prospective cohort
      study in 225 newly injured persons with SCI. OUTCOME MEASURE: Shoulder pain was
      assessed on five occasions up to 5 years after discharge. Latent class growth
      mixture modeling was used to identify the distinct shoulder pain trajectories.
      RESULTS: Three distinct shoulder pain trajectories were identified: (1) a "No or 
      Low pain" trajectory (64%), (2) a "High pain" (30%) trajectory, and (3) a
      trajectory with a "Decrease of pain" (6%). Compared with the "No or Low pain"
      pain trajectory, the "High pain" trajectory consisted of more persons with
      tetraplegia, shoulder pain before injury, limited shoulder range of motion (ROM),
      lower manual muscle test scores, or more spasticity at t1. Multiple logistic
      regression analysis showed two significant predictors for the "High pain"
      trajectory (as compared with the "No or Low pain" trajectory): having a
      tetraplegia (odds ratio (OR) = 3.2; P = 0.002) and having limited shoulder ROM
      (OR = 2.8; P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Shoulder pain in people with SCI follows
      distinct trajectories. At risk for belonging to the "High pain" trajectory are
      persons with tetraplegia and those with a limited shoulder ROM at start of active
      rehabilitation.

TI  - Rotator Cuff Lesions in Patients with Stiff Shoulders: A Prospective Analysis of 
      379 Shoulders.
PG  - 1233-7
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.N.00910 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic adhesive capsulitis is defined as a frozen shoulder with
      severe and global range-of-motion loss of unknown etiology. The purpose of our
      study was to clarify the prevalence of rotator cuff lesions according to patterns
      and severity of range-of-motion loss in a large cohort of patients with stiff
      shoulders. METHODS: Rotator cuff pathology was prospectively investigated with
      use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasonography in a series of 379
      stiff shoulders; patients with traumatic etiology, diabetes, or radiographic
      abnormalities were excluded. Eighty-nine shoulders demonstrated severe and global
      loss of passive motion (</=100 degrees of forward flexion, </=10 degrees of
      external rotation with the arm at the side, and internal rotation not more
      cephalad than the L5 level) and were classified as having severe and global loss 
      of motion (Group 1). The remaining 290 shoulders were divided into two groups:
      those with severe but not global loss (Group 2; 111 shoulders) and mild to
      moderate limitation (Group 3; 179 shoulders). RESULTS: Among all shoulders,
      imaging demonstrated an intact rotator cuff in 51%, a full-thickness tear in 35%,
      and a partial-thickness tear in 15%. In Group 1, 91% had an intact rotator cuff
      and 9% had a partial-thickness rotator cuff tear. No patient in this group
      demonstrated a full-thickness tear. In Group 2 and Group 3, respectively, 44% and
      35% of the shoulders were intact, 17% and 16% had a partial-thickness tear, and
      39% and 50% had a full-thickness tear. CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder stiffness with
      severe and global loss of passive range of motion is not associated with
      full-thickness rotator cuff tears, although some patients may have a
      partial-thickness tear. Shoulders with severe and global loss of range of motion 
      at a first visit are likely to be cases of idiopathic adhesive capsulitis and may
      not require further imaging studies.

TI  - Hemiplegic shoulder pain: associated factors and rehabilitation outcomes of
      hemiplegic patients with and without shoulder pain.
PG  - 237-45
LID - 10.1310/tsr2103-237 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the incidence of and the factors associated with shoulder 
      pain in people with hemiplegia and to understand the effect of rehabilitation
      programs on the parameters of motor function and activity limitations in patients
      with and without hemiplegic shoulder pain. METHODS: Patients in the initial
      6-month period after stroke who were hospitalized in the physical medicine and
      rehabilitation clinic were included in the study. Patients were considered early 
      rehabilitation entrants if they were admitted in the first 0 to 30 days after a
      stroke and late rehabilitation entrants if they were admitted 30 to 120 days
      after a stroke. Demographic and clinical features, complications, and medical
      histories of the patients were recorded. Upper extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor
      Assessment (FMA), Frenchay Arm Test (FAT), and Functional Independence Measure
      (FIM) were applied to the patients on admission, at discharge, and after 1 month 
      of follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-one (38%) patients did not have shoulder pain, and 
      34 (62%) patients had decreased shoulder pain. Immobilization, duration of
      disease, and late rehabilitation were shown to be effective treatments for
      shoulder pain. The major risk factors were disease duration and poor initial
      motor function. In both groups, the FMA, FAT, and FIM scores showed significant
      changes. This improvement did not differ between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION:
      Duration of disease and low motor functional capacities have the most important
      impact on shoulder pain. In patients with and without shoulder pain, a systematic
      rehabilitation program is beneficial with respect to motor function and daily
      living activities.

AB  - Shoulder pain is a common symptom in the adult population. The most common cause 
      of shoulder pain is SIS, reflecting a problem with the rotator cuff or
      subacromial bursa. Determining the cause of a patient's pain is usually a
      clinical diagnosis based on careful history taking and physical examination.
      Limited use of imaging studies will be needed in the setting of trauma, possible 
      glenohumeral arthritis, or when a complete tendon tear is suspected. Therapy is
      based on pain control and therapeutic exercises in almost all cases. Despite the 
      prevalence of shoulder pain, there is no consensus on the best way to achieve
      pain control or on the type of exercise most likely to achieve speedy recovery.

TI  - Somatosensory impairments are common after stroke but have only a small impact on
      post-stroke shoulder pain.
PG  - 307-13
LID - 10.2340/16501977-1274 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether somatosensory impairments are more common in
      individuals with post-stroke shoulder pain than in those without post-stroke
      shoulder pain and healthy controls. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of a convenience
      sample. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine individuals with stroke, 24 with and 25 without 
      post-stroke shoulder pain (median age 65 years), and 11 age- and sex-matched
      healthy controls. METHODS: Perception and pain thresholds for cold, warm and heat
      (thermal thresholds), and pain thresholds for pressure and pin prick (mechanical 
      thresholds) were assessed using quantitative sensory testing (QST). Passive range
      of motion, motor function, resistance to passive movements, light touch and
      proprioception were assessed in the upper extremities. Shoulder pain
      characteristics were recorded in the post-stroke shoulder pain group. RESULTS:
      There were no significant differences between the group with post-stroke shoulder
      pain and the group without post-stroke shoulder pain in any of the QST
      assessments, but more participants in the post-stroke shoulder pain group
      reported abnormal cold sensation in the affected side. Both stroke groups had
      generally higher thermal thresholds and more extreme low or high mechanical
      thresholds than the healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Somatosensory impairments are
      common among individuals with stroke compared with healthy controls. The
      non-significant differences in QST thresholds between the group with post-stroke 
      shoulder pain and the group without post-stroke shoulder pain indicate that
      somatosensory impairments have only a small impact on post-stroke shoulder pain.

TI  - Peripheral nerve stimulation compared with usual care for pain relief of
      hemiplegic shoulder pain: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 17-28
LID - 10.1097/PHM.0000000000000011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to establish the efficacy of single-lead, 3-wk
      peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) therapy for pain reduction in stroke survivors
      with chronic hemiplegic shoulder pain. DESIGN: This study is a single-site,
      pilot, randomized controlled trial of adults with chronic shoulder pain after
      stroke. Participants were randomized to receive a 3-wk treatment of single-lead
      PNS or usual care. The primary outcome was the worst pain in the last week (Brief
      Pain Inventory, Short Form, question 3) measured at baseline and weeks 1, 4, 12, 
      and 16. The secondary outcomes included pain interference (Brief Pain Inventory, 
      Short Form, question 9), pain measured by the ShoulderQ Visual Graphic Rating
      Scales, and health-related quality-of-life (Short-Form 36 version 2). RESULTS:
      Twenty-five participants were recruited, 13 to PNS and 12 to usual care. There
      was a significantly greater reduction in pain for the PNS group compared with the
      controls, with significant differences at 6 and 12 wks after treatment. Both PNS 
      and usual care were associated with significant improvements in pain interference
      and physical health-related quality-of-life. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term PNS is a
      safe and efficacious treatment of shoulder pain. Pain reduction is greater
      compared with usual care and is maintained for at least 12 wks after treatment.

TI  - Prevalence and factors associated with neck, shoulder and low back pains among
      medical students in a Malaysian Medical College.
PG  - 244
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-6-244 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main purpose of the study was to assess the prevalence, body
      distributions and factors associated with musculoskeletal pain (MSP) among
      medical students in a private Malaysian medical college. METHOD: This
      cross-sectional study was conducted among 232 medical students in a private
      medical college using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was a modified
      Standardized Nordic Questionnaire focused on neck, shoulder and low back pain in 
      the past week and the past year. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty two medical
      students responded to the questionnaire out of 642. Mean age was 20.7 +/- 2.1
      years. The majority were female (62.9%), Malay (80.6%) and in the preclinical
      years (72%). One hundred and six (45.7%) of all students had at least one site of
      MSP in the past week and 151 (65.1%) had at least one site of MSP in the past
      year. MSP in the past week was associated significantly with the academic year,
      (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.15-3.67, P = 0.015), history of trauma (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.3,
      P = 0.011), family history of MSP (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.9, P = 0.023) and Body
      Mass Index (BMI) (P = 0.028). MSP in the past year was significantly associated
      with computer use (P = 0.027), daily hours of computer use (median +/- IQR (5.0
      +/-3.0), history of trauma (OR 7.5, 95% CI 2.24-2.56, P < 0.01) and family
      history of MSP (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.31-4.90, P = 0.006). On multivariate analysis,
      factors associated with MSP during the past week were a family history of MSP (p 
      = 0.029) and BMI (p = 0.03). Factors associated with MSP during the past year
      were being in clinical years (p = 0.002, computer use (p = 0.038), and a history 
      of trauma (p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: MSP among medical students was relatively
      high, thus, further clinical assessment is needed in depth study of ergonomics.
      The study results indicate that medical school authorities should take measures
      to prevent MSP due to factors related to medical school. Students should make
      aware of importance of weight reduction to reduce MSP.

TI  - Cervical intradural lipoma with associated hemivertebra formation at C6 level: a 
      case report.
PG  - 187-90
AB  - UNLABELLED: INTRODUCTION AND CASE DESCRIPTION: Intramedullary lipomas are rare
      tumours of the spinal cord and account for about 1% of all spinal neoplasms.
      These lesions can occur anywhere along the length of spinal cord, but are
      frequently localized to the lower thoracic and lumbosacral levels. The authors
      present a 18-year-old female with intractable shoulder and neck pain and
      progressive weakness in the upper extremities, harbouring a cervical intradural
      lipoma with intramedullary extension, along with concomitant scoliosis.
      CONCLUSION: Despite its benign nature, surgical treatment of these lesions in
      symptomatic patients generally provides satisfactory relief of symptoms. Radical 
      removal of spinal intradural lipomas is not recommended since attempts at
      complete excision carry an unacceptable risk of postoperative morbidity and
      sufficient decompression with or without duraplasty generally provides a
      successful clinical outcome.
